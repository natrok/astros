If you've made it this far, it's probably because you identify with one of the following situations:<br><br>
• Are you excited about the challenge of learning a new language but have many doubts about what you should do and how?<br><br>
• Spanish is on your list of priorities (I get it, same here).<br><br>
• You would like to feel more confident and secure speaking Spanish in a variety of everyday life contexts.<br><br>
• You're worried about not understanding grammar, mispronouncing words, or forgetting vocabulary, but you're eager to face the challenge of speaking a second language naturally and fluently.<br><br>
• You would like to better understand Hispanic culture in a practical and simple way, or you just want to learn how to interact in a context where using Spanish is important.<br><br>
• Or you simply want to communicate easily and simply when traveling to a Spanish-speaking country.
Now imagine that you know exactly what specific activities you can do to stimulate your learning at each stage of the language acquisition process.<br><br>
To get a better job, to travel, to make Spanish-speaking friends, to learn about another culture, or simply because you enjoy it.
