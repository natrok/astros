I am Lady Rodr√≠guez, a professional in pedagogy, a Colombian Spanish teacher with more than 4 years of experience in the process of learning Spanish as a foreign language, committed to education. <br><br>  

In 2012, upon finishing my degree, I felt it was time to apply what I had learned. My first step was to work in a conventional school, where the main focus was preparing children for literacy. However, in 2013 I decided to seek a new experience and started an active pedagogy project in a Children's Aid Foundation.<br><br>  

The following year, in 2014, an opportunity arose to work in social integration kindergartens. For two years, I was a professional teacher in the field, dedicating myself to the comprehensive care of early childhood. At the end of 2015, after a long three-year selection process and a state-level merit competition, I was appointed as a professional teacher in a public educational institution.<br><br>  

Despite this, my desire to continue growing personally and professionally led me to make an important decision in 2016: **I traveled to France!** My dream was to learn a second language, study, and explore the world, and finally, my savings gave me the opportunity to conquer new learning experiences.<br><br>  

In France, while studying French, I also worked as a nanny and Spanish teacher. Fate brought me back to Colombia after a few months, and the knowledge I acquired allowed me to work as a French teacher between 2017 and 2018 in preschool and primary school. In 2019, I returned to France to continue my training in teaching Spanish as a foreign language. Over the past few years, I have had wonderful experiences with my students, accompanying them in their learning processes for professional or personal reasons, both in language institutes and private lessons, in-person and online. Currently, I continue to offer classes virtually and in-person on various national and international platforms.<br><br>
